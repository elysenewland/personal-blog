Hey there! I'm Elyse, an occupational therapist learning to code.

After 7 years in school and 5 years of practice, I've found the U.S. healthcare system an intolerable place to work.

I loved my work as an OT, but the system continues to force unethical productivity standards, and companies provide less pay/worse benefits. Insurance companies constantly reduce patient visits and provide less coverage for care. The system sees dollars, not people.

It's why I'm studying to become a full-stack web developer.

Coding requires creative problem-solving and is both an art and a science, just like OT. I'm working towards becoming a full-stack developer and ready to learn more about web accessibility.

I'm excited to share my coding journey with you.

Cheers to new adventures! ðŸ˜Š
